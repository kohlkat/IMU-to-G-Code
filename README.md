# IMU-to-G-code Real-time Conversion System

This project aims to develop a system that can convert Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) spatial readings into G-code commands for CNC machines in real-time. By leveraging IMU data, this system can enable new applications in robotics, automation, and human-machine interaction.

## Goals

1. Acquire IMU data in real-time, including acceleration, gyroscope, and magnetometer readings.
2. Process and filter IMU data to obtain accurate position and orientation estimates.
3. Develop an algorithm to convert IMU spatial readings into G-code commands, considering the specific kinematics and constraints of the CNC machine.
4. Integrate the conversion algorithm into a CNC controller system, such as TinyG or GRBL.
5. Test and refine the system to ensure accurate and reliable real-time conversion of IMU data to G-code.
6. Implement safety features and error handling to ensure safe and reliable operation.
7. Collaborate with the worldwide community to improve and expand the system's capabilities.

## Current Status
