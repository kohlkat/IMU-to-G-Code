# 🤖 IMU-to-G-code Real-time Conversion System

This project aims to develop a system that can convert Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) spatial readings into G-code commands for CNC machines in real-time. By leveraging IMU data, this system can enable new applications in robotics, automation, and human-machine interaction.

## 🚀 Project Roadmap

### 🔧 Phase 1: Prototype Development
1. Select an IMU for prototyping: MPU-6050 or BNO055
2. Choose a platform for prototyping: Arduino (e.g., Arduino Uno or Arduino Mega)
3. Develop and test the IMU data acquisition and processing system
4. Implement a basic G-code conversion algorithm
5. Integrate the conversion algorithm with a CNC controller system
6. Evaluate and refine the prototype

### ⚙️ Phase 2: Performance Optimization
1. Evaluate the performance of the prototype and identify areas for improvement
2. Optimize the IMU data processing algorithms for accuracy and efficiency
3. Implement advanced G-code conversion techniques
4. Test the improved system and compare performance with the prototype

### 🏭 Phase 3: Production-Ready Development
1. Select a high-performance hardware platform for the final product (e.g., STM32, Raspberry Pi, or other ARM Cortex-M microcontroller)
2. Port the developed code to the new hardware platform
3. Optimize the software for real-time performance
4. Implement safety features and error handling
5. Test and validate the production-ready system

### 📚 Phase 4: Documentation and Maintenance
1. Create user manuals and technical documentation
2. Develop tutorials and guides for users and developers
3. Maintain the codebase, addressing bugs and feature requests
4. Collaborate with the community to improve and expand the system
